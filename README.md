# PHSI 490 Dissertation code
## By Cole Jonathan Barnes-Wilkie, supervised by Craig Rodger.

The code in this repository was made for the PHSI 490 Dissertation as required to obtain a BSc(Hons). The project relates to solar proton events (SPEs) and the POES data was obtained from Craig Rodger (which unfortunately cannot be uploaded to GitHub). This branch is oh-so temporary.
