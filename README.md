# PHSI 490 Dissertation code
## By Cole Jonathan Barnes-Wilkie, supervised by Craig Rodger.

The code in this repository was made for the PHSI 490 Dissertation as required to obtain a BSc(Hons). The project relates to solar proton events (SPEs) and the POES data was obtained from Craig Rodger (which unfortunately cannot be uploaded to GitHub). This branch in particular contains code that will get the cutoff fluxes, L shells, and MATLAB datenums over the time period of 2012/01/23 to 2012/01/31 UTC, as well as doing this over ten different gradient averaging (see grad_check.m for more information about this).
